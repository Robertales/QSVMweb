# QSVMweb
A Web Application for Running Quantum-enhanced Support Vector Machine

This plataform introduces a web-based application acting as a tool for data preprocessing and classification in quantum machine learning environments. In particular, the proposed tool uses evolutionary prototype selection and PCA-based feature extraction so as to try to minimize the size of data and enable a more accurate classification performed by a quantum SVM algorithm run on processors belonging to the IBM Q family.
